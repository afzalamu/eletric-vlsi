## Projects

### Resistor Divider Circuit
This project demonstrates the process of creating a resistor divider circuit schematic and layout using Electric Binary Software. The simulation of waveform behavior using LTspice is also covered. The project includes schematic design, layout generation, SPICE code writing, and transient analysis.

### NMOS and PMOS IV Characteristics
Explore this project to learn about designing schematic setups for plotting NMOS and PMOS IV characteristics. The layouts are generated using Electric, and SPICE code is written for both schematic and layout. Simulated IV characteristics using LTspice provide insights into the behavior of these devices.

## Getting Started
1. Install [Electric Binary Software](https://link-to-electric.com) if not already installed.
2. Install [LTspice](https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/design-tools-and-calculators/simulation-tools/lts.html) for simulation.
3. Clone this repository to your local machine.
